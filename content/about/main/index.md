  I'm currently a member of the [GERMS lab](http://germslab.org) at Iowa State University. The focus of our work is in understanding how human activity affects the environment; specifically, we are studying the effects that agriculture has in soil and lake water systems. I previously studied how agriculture impacts biodiversity in soil communities and wrote [MetaFunPrimer](https://github.com/pommevilla/MetaFunPrimer), a pipeline that designs high-throughput qPCR primers to target specific functional genes within an environment. My current projects are in predicting harmful algal blooms in Iowa lakes and analyzing the effect of crop priming additions on nitrogen fixation. 

  Outside of my research, I like to sleep, play video games, and play Magic: the Gathering. I'm also currently learning TypeScript.
